 ///// GitHub 


 Repository = a folder containing code where any changes to the code are tracked by git. 
 (To create a repository, we create a new folder on our computer, and then run  git init  )


  GitHub = a service that lets us save our git repositories online. It also helps us: 
 -   backup our code in case we delete it on our computer 
 -   see the history of our code changes more easily 
 -   alternatives include Bitbucket and GitLab
